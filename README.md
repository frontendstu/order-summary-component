### What I learned

The Order Summary Component challenge ended up being a pretty straightforward challenge. There were a couple of aspects I had to think on and that was primarily with the background image positioning. Once I got that figured out (see below snippet), I was able to breeze through the rest of the project. I am finding that working in vanilla CSS is very referring back and fourth and I found that this made me make a couple of mistakes. I will stick with using Vanilla CSS a bit more just so I can demonstrate that I‚Äôm not reliant on Sass, but honestly who wouldn‚Äôt use Sass!

```css
body {
  background: var(--body-bg) var(--body-bg-img) repeat-x top / contain;
}
```
